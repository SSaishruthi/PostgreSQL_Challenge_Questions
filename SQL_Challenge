1. Query all columns for all American cities in CITY with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

SELECT *
FROM CITY
WHERE (COUNTRYCODE = 'USA' ) AND (POPULATION > 100000)


2. Query the names of all American cities in CITY with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

SELECT NAME
FROM CITY
WHERE (COUNTRYCODE = 'USA' ) AND (POPULATION > 120000)

3. Query a list of CITY names from STATION with even ID numbers only. You may print the results in any order, 
   but must exclude duplicates from your answer.
 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE (ID%2 = 0)

4. Let 'N' be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let N'  be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; 
   query the value of N-N' from STATION. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries 
   in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
   
SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION
